# Metaself

A simple service to publicly store and exchange metadata about yourself.

## Use cases
- you want to centralize a personal description (biography).
- you're tired of updating your avatar everywhere and you're not a huge
fan of Gravatar or WordPress (they're great).
- you're seriously tired of services asking you where your "personal"
website is.
- you have a publicly available email address that you sometimes change
and don't want to have to update it all around the web
- you're sadly harassed by stalkers and need to change your online
identity once in a while to get them off you're back, I truly hope to be
able to help you.
- you want people to know where you live right now but you keep moving
around the world because you're so damn lucky, we get it you're awesome,
give us all a break.
